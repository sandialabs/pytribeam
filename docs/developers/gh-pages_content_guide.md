As autoscript cannot be installed in a virtual environment and requires a license, content for githubpages must be generated locally on a licensed machine. This file contains instructions and commands to create content for github pages for the gh-pages branch.

# overwriting gh-pages

In order to manually overwrite the content of gh-pages, you should start from an up-to-date version of the "main" branch:

```sh
git switch main
git pull
```

From here you can checkout and reset the gh-pages branch:

```sh
git checkout -B gh-pages
```

Now build the various pages by following the sections below:

- [userguide](#userguide)
- [api-docs](#api-docs)
- [test_coverage](#test-coverage)
- [linting](#lint-logs)
- [versioning](#versioning)

Once all the new build content is added, modify the top of the .gitignore file by changing the top lines from this:
```
# gh-pages stuff (need to build locally from main)
badges/
coverage_reports/
logs/
docs/api/
docs/userguide/book/
```

to this:
```txt
# # gh-pages stuff (need to build locally from main)
# badges/
# coverage_reports/
# logs/
# docs/api/
# docs/userguide/book/
```

Now stage all changes and commit to the gh-pages branch:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Update gh-pages branch to reflect current main branch"
```

And finally push your commit:
```sh
git push -f origin gh-pages
```


## userguide

The userguide is built with mdbooks, a rust crate, so the local machine must have a version of rust installed with the following crates installed:
- mdbook
- mdbook-cmdrun
- mdbook-katex

From the root directory of the repo (directory containing README.md, pyproject.toml, book.toml, etc.) a developer can use the following commands to perform various actions related to the userguide.

The userguide can be edited in place as follows:
```sh
mdbook serve . --open
```

The userguide can be built with the following:
```sh
mdbook build .
```

The userguide badge can be created as follows, but this should only need to be done once:
```sh
# insecure curl (-k option)
curl -k -L -o badges/userguide.svg "https://img.shields.io/badge/userguide-Book-blue?logo=mdbook&logoColor=FFFFFF"
```

## api docs

```sh
pdoc ./src/pytribeam/  -o ./docs/api
test -d badges/ || mkdir -p badges
# anybadge -o -l api -v passing -f badges/api.svg -c green
#docstring coverage
DOCSTRING_COVERAGE_RAW=$(docstr-coverage --percentage-only src/ -e ".*(GUI)")
DOCSTRING_COVERAGE=$(printf "%.1f" "$DOCSTRING_COVERAGE_RAW")
echo "Coverage Percentage: $DOCSTRING_COVERAGE%"
# Determine badge color based on coverage percentage using awk for comparison
COLOR=$(awk -v coverage="$DOCSTRING_COVERAGE" 'BEGIN {
    if (coverage < 40) {
        print "red"
    } else if (coverage < 80) {
        print "orange"
    } else if (coverage < 90) {
        print "yellow"
    } else {
        print "green"
    }
}')
echo "badge color: $COLOR"
anybadge -o -l api -v "$DOCSTRING_COVERAGE% coverage" -f badges/api.svg -c "$COLOR"
```

## test coverage

In order to run tests, the user must install ``pyTriBeam`` in editable mode and add their computer name to the list of machines in the ``Constants`` module. To find your hardware name, you can run the following from a python terminal:

```python

```
Run test suite on TriBeam:
			0. Remove CBS stage restructions
                1. Turn on ebeam, focus and link Z
                2. open laser app and disable laser interlock (turn the key so laser can fire)
                3. Open EBSD software, enable proximity sensor and override alerts (Oxford only)

combine coverage, now make badge in git-bash terminal:

```sh
# pip install anybadge
test -d badges/ || mkdir -p badges/
LINES_COVERED=$(grep -oP 'lines-covered="\K[0-9]+' coverage_reports/combined/coverage.xml)
LINES_VALID=$(grep -oP 'lines-valid="\K[0-9]+' coverage_reports/combined/coverage.xml)
if [ "$LINES_VALID" -ne 0 ]; then \
    COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE=$(awk "BEGIN {printf \"%.1f\", ($LINES_COVERED / $LINES_VALID) * 100}"); \
    COLOR=$(awk -v coverage="$COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE" 'BEGIN { \
        if (coverage < 40) { print "red" } \
        else if (coverage < 80) { print "orange" } \
        else if (coverage < 90) { print "yellow" } \
        else { print "green" } \
    }'); \
    anybadge -o -l "Coverage" -v "$COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE%" -f badges/test-coverage.svg -c "$COLOR"; \
else \
    echo "Lines Valid is zero, cannot calculate coverage percentage."; \
fi
```

combined test coverage, delete .gitignore to push these up

## lint logs

Force black formmater to control line length:
```sh
black --line-length 79 ./src/pytribeam/module.py
```

Lint a specific file, no log:
```sh
pylint -v ./src/pytribeam/module.py
```

```sh
mkdir -p logs/
# pylint --output-format=text src/pytribeam | tee logs/lint.log || pylint-exit $?

# ignore GUI for linting
pylint -v --ignore=GUI src/pytribeam | tee logs/lint.log || pylint-exit $?

# pylint -v src/pytribeam | tee logs/lint.log || pylint-exit $? #ignore GUI for linting

test -d badges/ || mkdir -p badges/
PYLINT_SCORE=$(sed -n 's/^Your code has been rated at \([-0-9.]*\)\/.*/\1/p' logs/lint.log)
anybadge -o --label=lint --file=badges/lint.svg --value=${PYLINT_SCORE} 2=red 4=orange 8=yellow 10=green
```
